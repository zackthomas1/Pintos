	I wrote to the console using the puts() putsc() functions. I read character inputs using the input_getc() function.

	I added backspace functionality to the shell.
	I implemented functionality that allows the user to add aurguments to the 'whoami' command. 
	For instance, the command 'whoami Ardalan' will output 'Ardalan'.
